📌 Global News App

This is a small PHP & MySQL news website project I built while learning full-stack web development.
It allows users to:
	•	View all news articles
	•	Filter news by category
	•	Register and log in
	•	Post comments (as a logged-in user)
	•	Delete their own comments
	•	Admins can add or delete news and manage comments

⸻

💻 Tech Stack
	•	PHP (basic server-side logic)
	•	MySQL (database for storing news, users, comments, and categories)
	•	HTML & CSS (frontend layout and styling)
	•	MAMP (local development environment)

⚠️ Important Notes

I’m still in the learning process, and this project is mostly for practice and understanding core concepts.
I’m aware that:
	•	There are potential SQL injection risks (some queries aren’t yet fully parameterized).
	•	Passwords are stored in plain text (not secure – in a real app they should be hashed).
	•	Validation and error handling could be improved.
	•	The CSS and layout could be more responsive and cleaner.
	•	Code could be refactored for better readability and maintainability.

🎯 Learning Goals

With this project, I practiced:
	•	Basic CRUD operations in PHP
	•	Working with MySQL databases
	•	Session management for authentication
	•	Basic frontend styling with CSS
	•	Connecting backend and frontend logic
